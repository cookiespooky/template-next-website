### üîí Security Features
- **SSL/TLS encryption** with Let's Encrypt integration
- **Security headers** and HSTS
- **Rate limiting** and DDoS protection
- **Firewall configuration** (UFW)
- **Fail2ban** intrusion prevention
- **Non-root containers** for security
- **Environment variable protection**

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy and configure environment files
cp app/.env.example app/.env.dev
cp app/.env.example app/.env.staging  
cp app/.env.example app/.env.prod

# Edit with your configuration
nano app/.env.dev
nano app/.env.staging
nano app/.env.prod
```

### 2. Development Environment
```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/deploy_dev.sh

# Or manually
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Run migrations
./scripts/db_migrate.sh dev

# Access at: http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Server Setup (Production)
```bash
# On your VPS server, run the initialization script
./scripts/server_init.sh

# Configure DNS records for your domains
# Generate SSL certificates
sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com

# Deploy to production
./scripts/deploy.sh prod --backup
```

## üåç Environment URLs

| Environment | URL | Purpose |
|-------------|-----|---------|
| Development | `http://localhost:3000` | Local development |
| Development | `http://dev.example.com` | Remote development |
| Staging | `https://staging.example.com` | Pre-production testing |
| Production | `https://www.example.com` | Live production site |
| Test Area | `https://www.example.com/dev` | Static test cases |

## üîß Key Commands

### Deployment
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh dev                    # Deploy to development
./scripts/deploy.sh staging --backup       # Deploy to staging with backup
./scripts/deploy.sh prod --force           # Force deploy to production
```

### Database Management
```bash
./scripts/db_migrate.sh dev deploy         # Run migrations
./scripts/db_migrate.sh dev status         # Check migration status
./scripts/db_migrate.sh dev seed           # Seed database
./scripts/db_migrate.sh dev studio         # Open Prisma Studio
```

### Backup & Recovery
```bash
./scripts/backup.sh prod                   # Create production backup
./scripts/rollback.sh prod                 # Rollback to latest backup
./scripts/rollback.sh --list              # List available backups
```

### Monitoring
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps       # Check service status
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f  # View logs
curl http://localhost:3000/health                 # Health check
```
